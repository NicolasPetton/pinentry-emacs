* A pinentry that uses emacsclient to prompt for the passphrase

Put it somewhere, make it executable, tell =gpg= to use it as the
pinentry program.

If your emacs hangs, you might have to =C-g=, then you'll get asked,
then you may have to restart the action. Your passphrase will be
cached for some time.

This is probably totally insecure, and your passphrase may be leaked!
*Use at your own risk!*
