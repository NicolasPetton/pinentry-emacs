* A pinentry that uses emacsclient to prompt for the passphrase

Put it somewhere, make it executable, tell =gpg= to use it as the
pinentry program.

If your emacs hangs, you might have to =C-g=, then you'll get asked,
then you may have to restart the action. Your passphrase will be
cached for some time.
** Emacs
Add this to =.emacs.d/init.el= or similar:

:(defun pinentry-emacs (desc prompt ok error)
:  (let ((str (read-passwd (concat (replace-regexp-in-string "%22" "\"" (replace-regexp-in-string "%0A" "\n" desc)) prompt ": "))))
:    str)) 

This is probably totally insecure, and your passphrase may be leaked!
